## GRB Data Analysis Using 3ML
 Useful for complete Fermi data analysis from light curve to spectrum
 
 (a) Lightcurve code Demonstrates:
 - Extracts and Plot Composite Light curve of Fermi: NaI, BGO, LLE and LAT detectors
 - Binning for time-resolved analysis using 3ML commands
 - Writing the bins to PHAII type file for spectral analysis

 (b) Spectrum Analysis code demonstrates
 - Reading the Fermi GBM + LLE data file: Via 3ML plugin
 - Fitting the Band and BandHighecut empirical models for the Bayesian blocks
 - Plotting and Storing the evolution of fit parameters
