## GRB_Data_Analysis
 Useful for complete Fermi data analysis from light curve to spectrum
 
 (a) Lightcurve code Demonstrates: 
     (1) Extracts and Plot Composite Light curve of Fermi: NaI, BGO, LLE and LAT detectors
     (2) Binning for time-resolved analysis using 3ML commands
     (3) Writing the bins to PHAII type file for spectral analysis

 (b) Spectrum Analysis code demonstrates
     (1) Reading the Fermi GBM + LLE data file: Via 3ML plugin
     (2) Fitting the Band and BandHighecut empirical models for the Bayesian bins obtained in the above step
     (3) Plotting and Storing the evolution of fit parameters
